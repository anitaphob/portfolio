<p>The portfolio consists of the most of the assignments handed in on the first semester from the multimedia design and communication programme. The main developed areas are business, communication and presentation, design and visualisation and interaction development. The studied subjects were basic web design, basic animation, basic UX and basic video. Although most of the first areas were included for progress in almost every new subject, there was one in particular to be focused on each project. In the weeks dedicated for the basic UX I felt the project was challenging my understanding of business context also, for example, along the user experience design. I found the most difficult part in the basic animation course, while dealing with javascript. My progress is something that I hope will prevail though every and with every project. </p>
